Remote Master is an Apple Remote utility to enhance the IR remote control of macOS. It has some useful features and still under construction. 

## Current working features:

- Control any media player application that can monitor media keys.
- Control priority lets you control iTunes only when itâ€™s playing. VOX will be the next. If both of them are not running, it will control another app that is monitoring the media keys.
- Long press the menu button to eject the optical drive.

## Plans:

- Add more exclusively controllable apps.
- Change applications priority to control.
- Configurable voice menu to execute useful actions.
- Apply shortcuts to remote keys.


This app is using [HIDRemote(BSDv3)](https://github.com/iospirit/HIDRemote) to handle Apple Remote event.

The app icon is designed by myself, you can like me on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/14594252-Remote-Icon).
